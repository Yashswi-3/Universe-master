**UniVerse**

This repository contains the codebase for the UniVerse project, I co-founded UniVerse to solve daily university challenges. Our digital solution streamlined event management, improved dining experiences, and enhanced laundry services. I gained experience in HTML/CSS for frontend, JavaScript for backend, and utilized MongoDB for its NoSQL capabilities.
